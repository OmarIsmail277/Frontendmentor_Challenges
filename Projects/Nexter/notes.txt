1-We could, of course, use media queries to adapt

in that situation, but it's far easier

to think responsive right from the beginning

and size the rows and the columns in a responsive

and flexible way right from the start, okay?

So always, always think about that when you're designing

and building content with CSS Grids.

2-@supports

display: grid

and then let's basically reset these properties.

Now we don't have to do it for all of them

because certain things are actually ignored

by grid containers and grid items.

And the same applies to flex containers and flex items.

So what gets ignored by CSS Grid and Flexbox,

are floats, display, inline-block, display:table-cell,

and vertical-align altogether, okay?

So this float here, we don't have to reset it

because it's actually ignored

now that this feature here is a grid item.

So all we have to do is to reset this width here,

set it to auto,

and the margin-bottom, we also need to get rid of that.
